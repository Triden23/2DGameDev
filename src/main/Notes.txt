Items, Status's such as poison or bleed
Loading game
Saving game
Level transitioning
Better Level loading (including entities)
Projectile system -> magic system --Need to make projectiles first. will be used in magic--
Mouse implementation --allow for aiming of projectiles, will start with dumb fire based on the direction the player or entitiy is moving so mobs can use it too--
Mini-games that have their own rewards or punishments have other stats affected.

UP THE AMOUNT OF FRAMES POSSIBLE for animations to 32 images per animation cycle



--In-progress--

Health bars of mobs
Friend Items

Bosses
--Ideas--
Mikey's - Synergies between items and classes. Berserker class + great sword at a certain level and a max tier weapon %5 chance to kill

--Requested Features--
Ability to have pets - specifically they asked for wolves

--Requested ITEMS--
Kamryn - Great axe -
Regular attack
Special attack - Channeled whirlwind(spin around)
Mikey - getsuga tenshou - Great Sword - flame effects
at max tier - basic - would be ranged like ichigos getsuga tenshou
at max tier - special - Fire shoots down onto the character and spreads out around you and does damage - think of water when you turn on the sink(cost's 10% of your max health and does damage based on that)

Trinity - Trinity's dagger
Parrying Dagger: Block an attack if input the direction right before the attack connects
Give monsters an window an in counter that is played during their attack animation. if the attack is within the window for the item parry the attack

Zoosky -

Dalton - sword bow
Bow that shoots swords, scales off of strength;

Aaron - Lucky Tornado - Reference to his league name - may need to seperate out movement direction and cast direction.
Tornado spell: spins character wildly(animation, not movement) and casts in random direction
